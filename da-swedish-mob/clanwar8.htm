    <tr>
        <td><p align="center">First of all everyone was argueing
        about whether the match should be an SQL match or an
        official or just a friendly match.Since we were going to
        play both maps at the IoP server (where they are able to
        play LAN) we thought it was a bit risky to make it an SQL
        match, cause we didn't know how good or bad the IoP
        connection was (in the end it turned out that the
        connection worked OK for us :). It was decided that the
        match should be counted as an official match (i.e. no
        SQL).MOB's choice: DM2, deathmatch 1, teamplay 3,
        powerups.IoP's choice: E3M3, deathmatch 1, teamplay 3.<br>
        We started at DM2, not much to say really, we were in
        command most of the match, though our teamplay didn't
        work so good we didn't give them any opportunities to
        threaten us. Score: 345 - 51. Then we played E3M3 (hmm, I
        can't understand why people want to play single-player
        maps in clanfights). Not much to say here either, we
        sucked, the map sucked, we lost, it sucked. Score: 107 -
        153. We played with a different line-up than usual,
        McCoy, HonK, kemiKal and NerdKiller (our new member :)
        and like we always do, we kicked ass (on our map
        atleast). Final Score: 452 - 204.<br>

        was very alike to most of final games in Quake SM, were
        one team get a good start and then control the map the
        whole game. As you can ser TGM got control in both halfs
        with lucky startrespawns and as both teams are equal
        strong (in my opinion at least) the start is most import
        factor in this game and many other games the last months.
        TGM won (easily) but with a different start we could have
        won also. In my opinion the old ID maps is starting to
        get to small for the best clans i 4vs4 matches we should
        play on larger maps (lika death32) with maybe a couple of
        players more (like 6vs6 or 8vs8) instead, then we would
        really see which players/clans are the best.</p>

        on their side, like the old clanchanger Xenon, who have
        meet us before in 2 different clans (1 win and 1 lost).
        It was close match, too close, mostly because of our lack
        of practice on their choice e3m3. We hade all key areas
        and a lead of 40-10 after a couple of minutes on their
        map, but something happen (maybe we accidently left the
        key areas) and we were slaughtered for the rest of the
        first half, and lost with 45 frags. But then we get our
        revenge on our map and started a furious hunt for the
        total lead, and after 10-15 minutes we hade a strong lead
        of about 100 frags and we could relax again, they did get
        some frags and the total difference were in the end only
        29 frags. But we wone this fight and we are the hunt to

        we had some hopes of winning this game, though we knewed
        that they were hard to beat (especially now in QW and
        their hard weekly training for several months). We
        started with our choice and we got a good start, but
        then... it all crashed for us, we lost our lead and
        Merlin (our newest mobster) got dissconnected and was
        gone for most of the half. Crusaders could then (4 vs 3)
        easilly take control of this map and we never had a
        chance with one man down. So our map was lost bigtime and
        we tried to fight back in the second half on their
        choice. The second hafl was close for a while but when we
        didnt get our lead that we needed to win the match, we
        lost our fighting spirit and crusaders wone this one too.
        But we were greatly dissapointed that we didnt get any
        restart on our map, when we played with only 3 guys for
        most of that half, but crusaders denied us that. So we
        will instead get our revenge next time, you can bet on
