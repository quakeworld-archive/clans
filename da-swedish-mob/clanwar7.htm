        ended good for us :) First half was hard and they got a
        lead early on this map that we never have played during a
        clan match before. We got back but they won with 16 frags
        on that map. Second half was a different ballgame, we
        ruled that map most of the game, with only a break when
        akke was dissconnected (with 48 frags that we have added
        to our score) and tPc got back in the game some what and
        got more frags during this part (when akke was missing)
        then during the rest of the half, but we got the control
        back as soon as we were 4 mobsters again. All mobs did a
        great job during this game, especially akke in both
        halfs, you can notice that the 2 old guys (&gt;30), llama
        and leon did some fragging too;) <br>
        We have a demo from the second half, i will soon have a
        link for it here or you can ask us if you want it.</p>
