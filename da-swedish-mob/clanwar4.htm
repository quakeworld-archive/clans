        teamplay 2, which handicaped us quite a bit (we lost
        about 20 frags on that rule). Then we played on their map dm6 and their modem
        (!) player Gringo really showed some excellent shaft
        techniques and burned us all over the place. This guy must be the best
        shafting modem (!) player around.We were completly
        crushed on dm6, must be our biggest defeat ever :( Our new modem player
        Aquila did his debute in the second half and did a great
        job altough that competion was hard in this one. Click here

        teddys, but this one was a hard one - we had a lot of
        problems with the server (that crashed when we had a dream start on the server) and a delay of
        50 minutes before the server started up again, which
        coused us to play with only 3 players the first 10 minutes of the game
        (a reason good enough for a rematch according to the SQL
        rules, but we wont demand a rematch, we are gentlemens ;-) and some
        strange finish times (not 30 minutes in the second half).
        But the teddys gaves us a good match and beat us on our choice
        dm3 (for the second time), snake in our team had some
        problems when the game was delayed for 50 minutes and had to change
        computer and played with wrong key-configuration and
        without sound (which is a big handicap). But we will get revenge on a
