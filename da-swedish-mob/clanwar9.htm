        on their choice e3m1 (strange, i can understand how they
        could get so many frags on a big map like that?) a map
        that we fought good on last time we meet them but now we
        had 2 players that never had played on this map in a
        clanfight so we really sucked and never got our teamplay
        (or hiding;-) to work. Congrats to CP for their revenge
        of our last meeting. Unfortunatelly i have a feeling that
        this maybe was the last SQL fight for our modemside for
        sometime, must of us have got tired of SQL and meeting
        the same teams every season and the games are getting
        more and more boring now when all the big clans are great
        at camping in clanfights and the games are almost always
        deciced in the start of the match (if you get a loosy
