        <p align="center">We were heavily outpinged, picture
        shows an average for them of 67 when our was 127.....hmm
        not very nice :(<br>
        The match started with DM6, our goal was obviously to
        gain control of the RA-RL area as quickly as possible,
        but they did some really heavy attacks so it took a while before
        we could establish any form of control there (I don't
        remember if we had total control there before the last minutes of
        the match). So it was a pretty close one...we were
        outpinged and they made some really good resistance also. On DM4 the server fucked up... :( noone could move... we
        couldn't play...had to fix another server. They suggested
        that we should play on their server where they could play LAN,
        but we thought it would be a very bad idea, so we managed
        to get a server running where we had almost equal ping..our
        average 66 their 57. It was a rather hysterical match
        where everybody was running around, fragging each other.... We finally won (read more <a
        href="../sql/battles/mob-iop.html">here</a>)
        and had only one match left in SQL - the final against
        BLI....</p>

        we had our two SQL-matches coming up.Our ping sucked
        royal dick! Our average was 120, theirs 46 !!! On E1M3 we played a rather tactical game.On
        DM2 they fragged us all over the place, pumping
        quad-rockets everywhere, but our margin we had made on E1M3 saved us. We finally got our revenge for our loss in the Gathering

        map like DM4. But guess that they suprised us bigtime and
        camped like no other clan before have done (to us). They really
        used this camping tactics to its extreme and benefitted a
        lot when they all played in the same room and warned each others
        everytime we got a hold of the RL and capture back the
        same RL position just seconds after we got there. They showed that they
        can play this tactic well, so next time ... no more

        Second map was an uphill struggle to get back all frags
