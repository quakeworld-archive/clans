        revenge against our 2 wins before in this SQLmatch. We
        had a bad start on dm2 and couldn´t get all frags back
        on dm4, so BLI won. We have added 5 frags on our score
        for a disconnect. Of course BLI didn´t wanna meet us in
        a QW match (now when we have become QWspecialists) so we
        had to play in regular lag quake (that we don´t like
        anymore). Im certained that the outcome would have been
        completly different if this match would have been played
        in QW instead.<br>
        But we have congratulate BLI on this win and their total
        win in SQL POTS division this season, but next season it
        will be in QW and then we will get our revenge :-)

        (301- -22 on dm2). All newbie clans should take this as a
        warning, if you are going to meet a big clan you must
        learn all the normal dmmaps that your opponent could
        choose and if you havn't played QW before learn it first

    <tr>
        <td><p align="center">This was the match, I think,
        everybody was, and has been, looking forward to. BLI had
        won every SQL-match they played and they had won
        big-time. We hadn't played BLI before so, frankly, we
        were quite nervous about this one. The match opened up
        and I think every single player on the map was more or
        less nervous. DM6 is a map where it exists one major
        keypoint i.e. the red armour - rocketlauncher. If you
        could control that area for a whole match you are very
        likely the winner of the map. So at the opening of the
        match both teams tried to get control there, but during
        the first stages of the match neither of the teams
        managed to get some good control. After a while we did
        get the red armour area secured, and by that time we had
        more frags than BLI, and after a while they stayed in the
        RL 100+ room and didn't leave, but since we had the RA
        and the other RL there was no problems in getting a few
        frags on hit and runs in their room and by the end of the
        game, MOB held both RL areas and were totally in control
        of the entire map so BLI didn't stand a chance
        whatsoever... a total crush. <br>
        <br>
        DM3, the good ol' mobster-map. This map was an own
        battle...the-undisputed-King-of-the-DM3 battle. BLI
        secured the RL at the start of DM3 and more or less held
        it for the whole match, we had the red armour and the
        super nailgun, so it was Rockets against Nails and
        believe it or not, we won. Two of us held the red armour
        (with our nails :) and the other two was hunting lonely
        RL-guys to spike with some nails so they could get their
        hands on a RL. I think this &quot;SQL-final&quot; is one
        of the best match we've ever played. We played like a
        team and not like a bunch of individuals like we used to.
        The future is our :)<br>
