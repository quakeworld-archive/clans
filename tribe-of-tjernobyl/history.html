                                        On the 28th of December, 1996, Tribe of Tjernobyl was founded by CapCop,
                                        RipperRoo and SeaShark. Originally all members came from
                                        Västerås, but that soon changed when the Tribe got an American division as well
                                        as a few more Swedish members. In the summer of 1997, ToT
                                        joined impulse's Clan Bloodfeast of the Triad and became it's b-team. CbT
                                        disbanded during the autumn of 1997 and the ToTers went
                                        separate ways for some time...
                                        <br><br>
                                        ToT was reunited in June 98, original members CapCop, PacMan and Sgt.Pepper and
                                        new-comer fekkz found eachother and took up where most of them had left little
                                        less than a year ago.
                                        Later on that summer impulse joined up, and the idea of having a team entirely
                                        from Västerås was borned. The chase was on and after some
                                        LANing Oddjob was discovered. When impulse, Oddjob and CapCop went to gymnasiet
                                        (high school?) they ended up in the same class, and QW became
                                        their mayor. ToT arranged a few QW-competitions at a local netcafe trying to
                                        discover additional local talents. The efforts paid off when
                                        Stykkz was recruited, autumn of 1998.
                                        <br><br>
                                        In 1999, ToT hosted two rather large LAN-parties in Västerås; ToT-Camp #1 &amp;
                                        #2. This was nothing new, but these events became the largest yet.
                                        At TC1 in March 99, ~100 QW-fanatics attended and a great 4-4 competition was
                                        played. The rest of the year was dedicated to playing random
                                        online games, most notably ToT managed to defeat the feared Norwegian clan Game
                                        Over in an official battle just one week before they attended
                                        the elite competition Fusion 99 accompanied by teams like Clan UK &amp; <a

                                        In 2000, ToT once again got their hands on a connection after some time of
                                        inactivity. After an agreement had been settled with <a
                                            href="http://www.teknikbyn.org/"
                                            target="top">Teknikbyn</a>
                                        in Västerås during the summer, ToT found themselves owning a small room with a
                                        2mbit connection. "Lokalen" still remains and is occupied... a lot. With the
                                        introduction of Lokalen, ToT's new generation;
                                        Slabby and Psycho_Dad, really started their training. Playing for ToTb together
                                        with Belgarath, sibbit and a few others they started to pick up the small
                                        details of QW 4-4.

                                        ToT made their first appearance in an important league. Although forced to
                                        disappear after a close defeat, 2-1, against Finland's <a

                                            target="top">Clan MalFunction</a> in
                                        the quarterfinal, ToT managed to turn a few heads by beating the finalist <a
                                            href="http://www.euthanasia.nu/"
                                            target="top">Euthanasia</a> in a group game. The game was played at
                                        Cottelan 2000 (a truly great LAN, as all the Cottelans have been) and must be
                                        one of ToT's most memorable moments, winning 2-1 after a thrilling decider on
                                        e1m2.

                                        although the performance was rather convincing during the group games, ToT once
                                        again
                                        found that the quarterfinal was the end station. Facing <a

                                        champions, ToT at least lost honourably.
                                        <br>
                                        In SD3 the new generation of ToT finally took over completely. With impulse and
                                        CapCop away doing their military service in the north of Sweden, ToT trusted
                                        Oddjob, Psycho_Dad, slabby and lethal to defend it's name.
                                        Winning the necessary games, ToT qualified for the playoffs as usual. This year
                                        became a small drawback in performance since the first game resulted in a loss,
                                        but of course we'll be there next year, hungrier than ever!
